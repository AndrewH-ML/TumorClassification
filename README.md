In this paper, several supervised machine learning models are explored and their accuracies compared. The models are  implemented in an attempt to classify the primary tumor location given the anatomical regions of the body which the cancer has spread. Each of the four models used produce similar accuracies in the range of 30% to 45%. The most significantly accurate model is… with an average accuracy of … While the accuracies were low to be considered a good classification model, an increased amount of training data could result in greater scores.
