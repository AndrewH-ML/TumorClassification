In this paper, several supervised machine learning models are explored and their accuracies compared. The models are  implemented in an attempt to classify the primary tumor location given the anatomical regions of the body which the cancer has spread. Each of the four models were similar in performance, with the logistic regression being prominent during the cross-validation, and the support-vector machine during testing. These models use limited data to make predictions that are far more reliable than a random  guess given the number of  unique targets in the dataset.
